## EFIgy

### Coming Soon! We're still squashing a bug and will release it ASAP after recovering from Ekoparty 13

The EFIgy API and related tools help you gain better visibility into the EFI environment on your Apple Mac systems and helps more easily identify out of date EFI firmware and vulnerabilities specific EFI versions may be vulnerable to.

There are also a lot of useful datasets within the EFIgy project that collate lots of hard to find infomration about things like Apple EFI versions and Board-ID's etc.

Check back and the code will be hear before you know it! Until then pease check out the technical paper we released [here](https://duo.com/blog/the-apple-of-your-efi-mac-firmware-security-research)
